	abstract = {Optimization models used in planning and scheduling systems are not exempt from inaccuracies. These optimization systems often require an expert to assess solutions and to adjust them before taking decisions. However, adjusting a solution computed by an optimization procedure is difficult, especially because of the cascading effect. A small modification in a candidate solution may require to modify a large part of the solution. This obstacle to the adjustment of a solution can be overcome by interactive reoptimization. In this paper we analyze the impact of the cascading effect on a shift-scheduling problem and propose an efficient heuristic approach for reoptimizing solutions. The proposed approach is a local-search metaheuristic that has been adapted to the reoptimization. This approach is evaluated on a set of problem instances on which additional preferences are generated to simulate desired adjustments of a decision maker. Experimental results indicate that, even with a small perturbation, the cascading effect is manifest and cannot be efficiently tackled by applying recovery actions. Moreover, results show that the proposed reoptimization method provides significant cost gains within a short time while keeping a level of simplicity and modularity adequate for an implementation in a decision support system. © 2014 is held by the owner/author(s).},

It links both historical information and real life realizations concerning the human centered processes. The historical points mentioned in the paper give only partial emphasis, according to the feeling of the authors. The aim, here, is essentially to review some tools (e.g., utility theory, cognitive modeling, etc.) that are or might be used to tackle new problems in the context of anthropocentered systems, especially when considering the recent evolution of Information Systems towards distributed ones. Several real-life problems (mostly in an industrial setting) are reviewed. They all concern applications on which the authors have worked (or are working) together. Ó 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {This article presents a review and a classification of interactive optimization methods. These interactive methods are used for solving optimization problems. The interaction with an end user or decision maker aims at improving the efficiency of the optimization procedure, enriching the optimization model, or informing the user regarding the solutions proposed by the optimization system. First, we present the challenges of using optimization methods as a tool for supporting decision making, and we justify the integration of the user in the optimization process. This integration is generally achieved via a dynamic interaction between the user and the system. Next, the different classes of interactive optimization approaches are presented. This detailed review includes trial and error, interactive reoptimization, interactive multiobjective optimization, interactive evolutionary algorithms, human-guided search, and other approaches that are less well covered in the research literature. On the basis of this review, we propose a classification that aims to better describe and compare interaction mechanisms. This classification offers two complementary views on interactive optimization methods. The first perspective focuses on the user’s contribution to the optimization process, and the second concerns the components of interactive optimization systems. Finally, on the basis of this review and classification, we identify some open issues and potential perspectives for interactive optimization methods.},

	abstract = {This work presents an approach for distributed and contextualized reasoning in multi-agent systems, considering environments in which agents may have incomplete, uncertain and inconsistent knowledge. Knowledge is represented by defeasible logic with mapping rules, which model the capability of agents to acquire knowledge from other agents during reasoning. Based on such knowledge representation, an argumentation-based reasoning model that enables distributed building of reusable argument structures to support conclusions is proposed. Conﬂicts between arguments are resolved by an argument strength calculation that considers the trust among agents and the degree of similarity between knowledge of different agents, based on the intuition that greater similarity between knowledge deﬁned by different agents implies in less uncertainty about the validity of the built argument. Contextualized reasoning is supported through sharing of relevant knowledge by an agent when issuing queries to other agents, which enable the cooperating agents to be aware of knowledge not known a priori but that is important to reach a reasonable conclusion given the context of the agent that issued the query. A distributed algorithm is presented and analytically and experimentally evaluated asserting its computational feasibility. Finally, our approach is compared to related work, highlighting the contributions presented, demonstrating its applicability in a broader range of scenarios, and presenting perspectives for future work.},

It will play a key role in the acceptance of emerging AI applications such as optimisation. Two important factors known to affect trust are system transparency, i.e., how well the user understands how the system works, and system performance. However, in the case of optimisation, it is difficult for the end-user to understand the underlying algorithms or to judge the quality of the solution. Through two controlled user studies, we explore whether the user is better able to calibrate their trust in the system when: (a) They are provided feedback on the system operation in the form of visualisation of intermediate solutions and their quality; (b) They can interactively explore the solution space by modifying the solution returned by the system. We found that showing intermediate solutions can lead to over-trust, while interactive exploration leads to more accurately calibrated trust. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},
