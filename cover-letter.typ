= Cover Letter for Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search

This manuscript is my first ever submission of a research paper. The solution method that I describe in the manuscript will form the basis for a later 
multi-actor/multi-model setup where metaheuristics will be able to communicate with each other in real-time. 

The method came to be in collaboration with a large energy company that needs help with scheduling maintenance operations. The method was 
necessary to allow a user/actor to manually "correct" the schedule in real-time, as the problem is very stochastic, has low data quality,
and ,in maintenance scheduling, reactive rescheduling is the prefered choice when it comes to handling uncertainty (as opposed to general stochastic
approaches in scheduling [robust optimization, stochastic optimization, fuzzy logic, etc.]).

I know that this paper is not ready and complete yet. The path of my Ph.D. has diverged significantly from its original goal, and my supervisors
are having a difficult time pointing my in the right direction. If you decide to reject the paper outright it is completely understandable, but 
if you decide get a small note to point me in a direction, however small and critical, it would be received with a lot of gratitude
