\section{Introduction}
\label{sec1}
%% Labels are used to cross-reference an item using \ref command.
Many problems that face the operation research field are hard to solve due to the need of tight integration within companies that (meta)heuristics and models 
are usually tested with. To solve operation research problems that are highly operational in nature there is a need for metaheuristics that are more 
responsive, that work with the user, and that allows for tight integration into user work-flows \cite{interactive-optimization-methods}. Operations in are often
characterized by extensive amounts negotiation and feedback on proposed solutions to general operations research problems (!!!). This often lead to a situation
where operation research methods are not used to solve the problem that their underlying model proposes to solve and instead end up providing suggestions 
instead of a complete solution (!!!). Operations in are often
characterized by extensive amounts negotiation and feedback on proposed solutions to general operations research problems (!!!). This often lead to a situation
where operation research methods are not used to solve the problem that their underlying model proposes to solve and instead end up providing suggestions 
instead of a complete solution (!!!). This paper proposes a solution method that will allow for real-time optimization based on user-interaction (effective 
altering the parameter space) and real-time connection to data sources, such to a database connections. To illustrate the solution method a variant of the
knapsack problem has been chosen, specifically the multi-compartment multi-knapsack problem on a large dataset. Furthermore the large neighborhood search 
metaheuristic has been chosen due to its properties of being able to work with and fix infeasible solutions. 

The paper is divided into four different sections. Section \ref{sec2} explains the model and method in detail that form the fundation of the paper. 
Section \ref{sec3} shows that results coming from the implemented system where the system will be affected by simulated user-interaction. Section \ref{sec4} 
will discuss the implications of the research and possible future research directions.

\section{Solution Method}
\label{sec2}


\subsection{The Multi-compartment Multi-knapsack Problem with capacity penalties}
\label{sub1sec2}
Here a variant of the knapsack problem is chosen as the problem to apply actor-based large neighborhood search on. It has been chosen due to its simplicity
while also being sufficiently computationally hard to be able to illustrate the rationale behind the solution approach. The model is comprised of 
five different sets. Here: $K$ is the number of knapsacks; $I$ is the number of items; $C$ is the number of compartments; $Q$ is a set that
defines which items should be excluded from a specific knapsack; $P$ is an inclusion set that defines the items which should be included in each 
knapsack. The model introduces four different parameters. Here: $v_{ik}$ is the value associated with item i in knapsack k; $d$ is the 
penalty paid for exceeding the compartment capacity; $w_{ic}$ is the capacity requirement for item i in compartment c; $cap_{kc}$ is the total amount 
of capacity available in knapsack k for compartment c. The decision-variables are: $x_{ik}$, which is a binary decision variable equal to one 
if item i is in knapsack k and zero otherwise; $p_{kc}$ is non-negative decision variable equal to the amount of excess capacity above 
the $c_{kc}$ in knapsack k for compartment c.
