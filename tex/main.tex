\label{sec:1-introduction}
%% Labels are used to cross-reference an item using \ref command.

Many problems in operation research are hard to solve due to the need of tight integration with tacit knowledge found in the minds of key decision makers 
that have to make decisions based on solutions provided by operation research methods such as metaheuristics and commercial solvers. 
To solve operation research problems that are highly operational in nature there three additional requirements for metaheuristics to have: 1.  
responsive, 2. able to be assimilated into the decision makers workflow, and 3. allows for integration into dynamic data source such as traditional databases \citep{meignan_review_2015}. 
Operational aspects of operation research, as opposed to strategic and tactical aspects, are often characterized by by extensive amounts negotiation and feedback on 
proposed solutions to general operations research problems (!!!). This can lead to a situation
where operation research methods are not used to solve the problem of their underlying model and instead provides intial suggestions \cite{meignan_review_2015}. In practice
operations are usually characterized by extensive negotiation and feedback on proposed "solutions" between relevant stakeholders.  

This paper proposes a solution method that will allow for real-time optimization based on user-interaction (changes to the parameter space) and connection to a dynamic 
data source (in practice a database connection). The proposed solution method will be based on the multi-compartment multi-knapsack problem on a large dataset. 
Further the large neighborhood search metaheuristic has been chosen due to its properties of being able to work with and fix infeasible solutions. 

The paper is divided into four different sections. Section \ref{sec:2-solution-method} explains the model and method in detail that form the fundation of the paper. 
Section \ref{sec:3-results} shows that results coming from the implemented system where the system will be affected by simulated user-interaction. Section \ref{sec:4-discussion} 
will discuss the implications of the research and possible future research directions.

\subsection{The Multi-compartment Multi-knapsack Problem with capacity penalties}
\label{sub1sec2}
A variant of the knapsack problem is applied to the actor-based large neighborhood search. It was chosen due to its simplicity
while also being sufficiently computationally hard to be able to illustrate the power behind the solution approach. The model is comprised of 
five different sets. Here: $K$ is the number of knapsacks; $I$ is the number of items; $C$ is the number of compartments; $Q$ is a set that
defines which items should be excluded from a specific knapsack; $P$ is an inclusion set that defines the items which should be included in each 
knapsack. The model introduces four different parameters. Here: $v_{ik}$ is the value associated with item i in knapsack k; $d$ is the 
penalty paid for exceeding the compartment capacity; $w_{ic}$ is the capacity requirement for item i in compartment c; $cap_{kc}$ is the total amount 
of capacity available in knapsack k for compartment c. The decision-variables are: $x_{ik}$, which is a binary decision variable equal to one 
if item i is in knapsack k and zero otherwise; $p_{kc}$ is non-negative decision variable equal to the amount of excess capacity above 
the $c_{kc}$ in knapsack k for compartment c. 

\begin{alignat}{2}
	& \text{Min} \quad \sum_{i = 1}^{I} \sum_{k = 1}^{K} v_{ik} \cdot x_{ik} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K} \sum_{c = 1}^C d \cdot p_{kc}   \label{eqn:objective_function_strategic} \\[1em]
    & \text{subject to:} \notag                                                                                                                                        \\[1em]
	& \sum_{i=1}^I w_{ic} \cdot x_{ik} \leq \ cap_{kc} + p_{kc}        && \forall k \in K, \forall c \in C                      \label{eqn:capacity_constraint}          \\[1em]
	& \sum_{i = 1}^{I} x_{ik} = 1                                      && \forall k \in K                                       \label{eqn:single_workorder_constraint}  \\[1em]
	& x_{ik} = 0                                                       && \forall (i, k) \in Q                                  \label{eqn:exclusion_constraint}         \\[1em]
	& x_{ik} = 1                                                       && \forall (i, k) \in P                                  \label{eqn:inclusion_constraint}         \\[1em]
	& x_{ik} \in \{0, 1\}                                              && \forall i \in I, \forall k \in K                      \label{eqn:x_integrality_constraint}     \\[1em] 
	& p_{kc} \in \mathbb{R}^{+}                                        && \forall k \in K, \forall c \in C                      \label{eqn:p_non_negativity_constraint}
\end{alignat}

Here the objective function \ref{eqn:objective_function_strategic} aims to minimize the total weight of all item set assignments under a penalty $d$ given for exceeding the 
capacity given by constraint \ref{eqn:capacity_constraint}. Constraint \ref{eqn:capacity_constraint} makes sure that all the weights $w_{ic}$ for each item in an item set, given that it
has been assigned, is lower than the capacity for each knapsack k and for each compartment c. $p_{kc}$ is the amount of exceed capacity that is needed for the current assignment of item sets to be feasible.
Constraint \ref{eqn:single_workorder_constraint} makes sure that each item set is assigned to atleast a single knapsack. Constraint \ref{eqn:exclusion_constraint} excludes item sets from 
certain knapsacks and constraint \ref{eqn:inclusion_constraint}  forces a specific item set to be in a specific knapsack. Constraint \ref{eqn:x_integrality_constraint} and \ref{eqn:p_non_negativity_constraint} 
specify the variable domain for $x_{ik}$ and $p_{kc}$ respectively. In this paper the effects of changing Q, P, cap, and v in real-time will be examined to determine their effects on the solution and objective value.

\section{Solution Method}
\label{sec:2-solution-method}

\subsection{Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search}
A problem that is subject to user-interaction and requires real-time feedback you need an optimization approach that is able to repair infeasible solutions and while also 
converging quickly. For this the large neighborhood search metaheuristic has been shown satisfy these requirements in the literature \cite{gendreau_handbook_2019}. 

The LNS metaheuristic is in its most basic form is implicitly defined for static problems meaning that the parameters that make up the problem instance is not subject to change 
after the algorithm has been started. To make the LNS able adapt to incoming information in real-time a message system have been implemented on top of the existing framework. This 
extension is shown in algorithm \ref{algo1}. In the pseudocode the $x$ 

\begin{algorithm}[H]
\caption{Actor-based Large Neighborhood Search}  \label{algo1}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input} queue = message queue
\State \textbf{Input} P     = problem instance
\State \textbf{Input} x     = initial solution
\State $x^b = x$
\While{true}
	\While{queue.has\_message()}
        \State m = queue.pop()
        \State $x$.update(m)
        \State $x^b$.update(m)
		
		\State P.update(m)
    \EndWhile
	
    \State $x^t = r(d(x))$
    \If{accept($x^t$,\ $x$)}                       \label{alg:acceptance_criteria_start}
        \State x = x$^t$
    \EndIf                                       \label{alg:acceptance_criteria_end}
    \If{$c(x^t) < c(x^b)$}                   \label{alg:objective_start}
        \State $x^b = x^t$
		\State queue($x^b$)
    \EndIf                                       \label{alg:objective_end}
\EndWhile
\Return $x^b$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The basic LNS setup have here been extended with a `message queue`. This message queue will be read from on every iteration of the LNSs main iteration loop. And here we should notice that the 
incoming message are able to change both the solutoin but also the problem instance itself. Here we see one of the defining features of the LNS metaheuristic in play, that due to its inherrent 
property of being able to optimize a solution that have become infeasible which is something that is very likely to happen when you change the parameter of the problem instance itself. 

Another less obvious property the message queue allows is for the algorithm to run indefinitely and instead of restarting the algorithm you instead pass messages to it to allow it be adjust both the solution space and the parameter space.
This property avoid the issue of time consuming initial convergence as the algorithm will be found in an optimimal state when the solution is perturbed.  

\section{Results}
\label{sec:3-results}
This results section will 1. introduce the data instance 2. show the effect of forcing item set in the specific knapsacks 3. show the effect of changing the 
knapsack capacities, and 4. show the effect of dynamically changing the item set weights.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:4-discussion}
There are multiple implications and new oppurtunities by adopting an approach to optimization as proposes by this paper. Some of these may not initially be completely obvious. In the discussion section we will go through the three 
most conseqential ones: 1. continual optimization saves the initial time it takes to reach converence significantly, 2. due to the message system the optimization approach will always be responsive to changes in both the parameter space
and the solution space, and 3. due to the strong encapsulation and message passing properties of the suggested optimization approach it becomes possible to apply the setup in multi-model and hierarchical model setups, providing an
approach for modelling and optimizing large scale systems. Finally a suggestion for future resarch directions will be given.
